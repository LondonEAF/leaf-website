On Wednesday 26th January we hosted our first event as LEAF.

The event consisted of a wine tasting event, where we sampled the best of Moldovan wine and listened to two speakers.

The first, Mr. Vasile Scutaru, a wine merchant from Moldova who related the founding of his family business and educated us about the wines we were sampling. While Moldovan wines are already sold around Europe, including in Italy, Spain and Norway, this event marked Mr Scutaruâ€™s first foray into the British market. His wines are due to be stocked in high end restaurants and hotels in London very soon.

The second speaker was Daniel Korski CBE. A former special advisor to David Cameron, he has worked in a number of positions around the world, in London, Washington DC, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan. To hear about his work firsthand was awe-inspiring, and his speech was both powerful and humorous.

Thank you so much to both of our speakers and to all who attended. The event was a great success and get in touch if you would like to hear more about these Moldovan wines!
