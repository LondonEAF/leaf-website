We are the London Education & Art Foundation, a charitable foundation working to promote emerging artists while simultaneously tackling education inequality in London.

Our aim is to see the funds generated from our exhibitions and shows pumped into schools and local groups championing the education of the underprivileged, and by joining us, you can support our mission. By working alongside schools and educational charities, we believe we are putting the money where it is needed the most.

So join us today: look around our [virtual gallery](@/gallery/index.md), sign up to our free [fortnightly newsletter](@/newsletter.md#leaf-newsletter) or [join us as a member](@/membership.md) for exclusive benefits.
